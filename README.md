I am a PhD student at Strasbourg University with a deep-rooted passion for quantum computing, I am committed to pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the fascinating world of quantum field theory and quantum information. My academic journey began at Constantine University, where I graduated with a master's degree in a thesis titled "Quantum Computation Using the Kitaev Honeycomb Model and Application on IBM Quantum Computers." Currently, my research interests primarily revolve around quantum applications into electronic structure problems.
